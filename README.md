# Build-your-First-Image-Processing-Project-with-CNN

CNNâ€™s were first developed and used around the 1980s. The most that a CNN could do at that time was recognize handwritten digits. It was mostly used in the postal sectors to read zip codes, pin codes, etc. The important thing to remember about any deep learning model is that it requires a large amount of data to train and also requires a lot of computing resources. This was a major drawback for CNNs at that period and hence CNNs were only limited to the postal sectors and it failed to enter the world of machine learning.
In 2012 Alex Krizhevsky realized that it was time to bring back the branch of deep learning that uses multi-layered neural networks. The availability of large sets of data, to be more specific ImageNet datasets with millions of labeled images and an abundance of computing resources enabled researchers to revive CNNs.

Deep learning is a booming field at the current time and most of the projects and problem statements use deep learning in any sort of work.  If you have to pick a deep learning technique for solving any computer vision problem statement then many of you including myself will go with a conventional neural network.
In this article, we will build our first image processing project using CNN and understand its power and why it has become so popular. In this article, we will walk through every step of developing our own convolutional model and build our first amazing project.
